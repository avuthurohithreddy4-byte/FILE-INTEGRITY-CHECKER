# ENTER DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED NOT LESS THAN SOO WORDS

The digital ecosystem, spanning critical national infrastructure, global finance, and personal data, is continually expanding, making Cyber Security an issue of paramount global concern. This field is fundamentally about protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. Its core objective is to ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) triad of information assets. Confidentiality means preventing unauthorized disclosure; Integrity ensures data accuracy and completeness; and Availability guarantees that authorized users have access to resources when needed. Cyber security encompasses various domains, including network security (firewalls, intrusion detection systems), application security (secure coding practices), and operational security (user permissions, policies, and procedures). The escalating sophistication of threats, from state-sponsored espionage and advanced persistent threats (APTs) to mass-scale ransomware attacks, necessitates a proactive, multi-layered, and adaptive defence strategy that goes beyond simple perimeter protection.

The traditional reactive approach to security is no longer sufficient. This is where Ethical Hacking, or penetration testing, emerges as an indispensable practice. Ethical hacking involves authorized attempts to penetrate a system or network to find vulnerabilities that a malicious attacker could exploit. By mimicking the tools, techniques, and mindset of a Black Hat hacker, an Ethical Hacker (White Hat) provides a crucial preemptive strike capability. The findings of ethical hacking exercises are reported back to the organization, allowing them to patch weaknesses before they can be leveraged for harm.

The process of ethical hacking typically follows five distinct phases: Reconnaissance (information gathering), Scanning (identifying open ports and services), Gaining Access (exploiting a vulnerability), Maintaining Access (installing backdoors for future access), and Covering Tracks (erasing evidence of the intrusion). This systematic approach ensures comprehensive vulnerability assessment across an enterprise's entire digital footprint. Crucially, ethical hacking operates strictly within a legal and ethical framework, always requiring explicit permission before any activity commences.

The synergy between Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking is foundational to modern risk management. Cyber security sets the defensive policies and deploys protective technologies, while ethical hacking rigorously tests the effectiveness of these very defences. For organizations in India, where digital transformation and adoption of cloud services are accelerating rapidly, this combined approach is critical for compliance with regulations like the IT Act 2000 and sector-specific guidelines. Furthermore, the burgeoning demand for skilled professionals in India—security analysts, penetration testers, and security architects—highlights the fields' growing significance as a career path. Ultimately, the successful defence of the digital realm rests on the continuous, iterative cycle of building robust security (Cyber Security) and systematically breaking it to find flaws (Ethical Hacking), creating a resilient posture against the relentless tide of cyber adversaries.
